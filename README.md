 ## 🎮 Features

**Classic Flappy Bird gameplay** — The original frustration, now with a splash of artificial intelligence!

**Two game modes** — Play as a human (click or space to flap), or sit back and watch the AI learn.

**NEAT-powered neural networks** — AI birds train themselves through generations of natural selection. Watch them fail, adapt, and eventually fly like pros!

**Real-time evolution visualization** — See the population’s progress: which bird survived the longest, and how each generation gets smarter.

**Save & replay top performers** — The best AI bird from each run is saved, so you can compare champions or replay their epic flights.

**Multiplayer and more features coming soon!** — Race against friends or AI rivals in the upcoming multiplayer update. Watch this space!


## 🧠 How It Works
This project combines pygame for graphics and NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) for AI learning. Each bird is controlled by a neural network. Early generations fail embarrassingly quickly, but over time, the fittest birds learn to navigate the pipes like true champions.

**Watch evolution in action:**
See which neural architectures survive, how fast they learn, and how the population adapts to the ever-increasing challenge.

**Save & compare:**
The best-performing bird from each session is saved for later playback, so you can relive the glory (or the catastrophic failures).

## 🎯 How to Play

**Human Mode:** Click the mouse or press the space bar to flap your wings.

**AI Mode:** Sit back and enjoy the AI circus—watch generations of birds improve their skills live on your screen.

**Coming Soon:** Multiplayer mode—compete head-to-head with friends or AI opponents.
